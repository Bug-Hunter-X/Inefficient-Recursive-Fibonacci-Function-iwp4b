# Inefficient Recursive Fibonacci

This repository demonstrates an example of an inefficient recursive function for calculating the Fibonacci sequence in Python. The original code suffers from redundant calculations, leading to exponential time complexity. A more efficient solution using dynamic programming is provided for comparison.
